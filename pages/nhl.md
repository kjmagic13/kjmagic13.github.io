# MOCK NHL

* [Season Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W7_MIBiKyBPYWA_xFp5_KlQyzoDVRuYDoWFh5XFWY9A/edit#gid=940590117)

## Rules

A game should use the default settings:

* NHL mode
* 4 minute periods
* Goalie mode on

__A team is eliminated once its calculated cumulative losses exceeds 2__. A loss (L) counts as one loss and an overtime loss (OTL) counts as a half loss.

__A player wins once they are the only Division that has teams remaining__.

*Away* and *Home* asssignments are randomly chosen at the begining of each game. Take note as to what you are assigned as __this and a game's final score could affect a tie in the rankings__.
