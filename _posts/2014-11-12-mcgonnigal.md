McGonnigal Consulting recently made the switch to WordPress. They liked the standard TwentyTwelve theme but their previous logo wasn't wide enough to fit in the theme's header divisional. Using their former logo as a guide, the new header—save the background image of zeros and ones—was created entirely with CSS.
